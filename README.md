# PDF RAG AI Using Gemini API

This project allows you to upload PDFs and ask questions about them using local embeddings and the Gemini API for natural language generation.

---

## Features

- Extract PDF text locally and chunk it  
- Generate embeddings locally with SentenceTransformers (no cost)  
- Use Gemini API to generate answers based on retrieved context  
- Interactive web interface via Streamlit  
- Requires a Gemini API key set in `.env`

---

## Setup

1. Create a `.env` file in the root folder and add your API key:

```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
```

2. Install dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Running the App

Start the Streamlit app with:

```
streamlit run app.py
```

- Upload your PDF using the sidebar  >>
- Click “Index PDF” to process  
- Ask questions about your uploaded documents  
- Receive answers generated by Gemini API

## Notes

- Embeddings are generated locally and cost nothing  
- Gemini API calls require internet connection and API key  
- Keep your `.env` file private and different per environment
